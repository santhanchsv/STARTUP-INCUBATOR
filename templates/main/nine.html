        <h2>Making The Right Choice</h2>
        <p>It is important to choose your business structure carefully as your Income Tax Returns will depend on it. While registering your enterprise, remember that each business structure has different levels of compliance that need to be met with. For example, a sole proprietor has to file only an income tax return. However, a company has to file an income tax return as well as annual returns with the registrar of companies.</p>
        <p>A company’s books of accounts are to be mandatory audited every year. Abiding by these legal compliances requires spending money on auditors, accountants and tax filing experts. Therefore, it is important to select the right business structure when thinking of company registration. An entrepreneur must have a clear idea of the kind of the legal compliances he/she is willing to deal with.</p>
        <p>While some business structures are relatively investor-friendly than others, investors will always prefer a recognized and legal business structure. For example, an investor may hesitate to give money to a sole proprietor. On the other hand, if a good business idea is backed by a recognized legal structure (like LLP, Company, etc) the investors will be more comfortable making an investment.</p>
        
        <h2>Ask Yourself</h2>
       

 <p>Let’s take a look at some important questions every entrepreneur must ask himself before he/she finally decide upon a business structure.</p>
        
        <h3>How many owners/partners will your business have?</h3>
        <p>If you are a single person who owns the entire initial investment required for the business, a One Person Company would be ideal for you. On the other hand, if your business has two or more owners and is actively seeking an investment from other parties a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or Private Limited Company would suit you best.</p>
        
        <h3>Should your initial investment determine your choice of business structure?</h3>
        <p>The answer to that question is – Yes if you want to spend less initially, it would be wise to go in for a Sole Proprietor, or a HUF or a Partnership. But, if you are sure that you will be able to recover the setup and compliance costs, you can opt for a One Person Company, LLP or a Private Limited Company</p>
        
        <h3>Willingness to bear the entire liability of the business</h3>
        <p>Business structures like sole proprietor, HUF, and partnership firm have unlimited liability. This means, in case of any default in loans, the entire money will be recovered from the members or partners in profit sharing ratio. The risk to personal assets is high in these cases. Whereas, Companies and LLPs have a limited liability clause. This means that the liability of its members is restricted to the amount of contribution made by them or the value of shares each member holds.</p>
        
        <h3>Income Tax Rates Applicable to businesses</h3>
        <p>The income tax rates applicable to a sole proprietorship and a HUF are the normal slab rates. In case of a sole proprietorship, the business income is clubbed with the individual’s other income. But in the case of other entities like partnership and company a tax rate of 30% is applicable.</p>
        
        <h3>Plans of getting money from investors</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to get investments when your business structure is unregistered. Entities like LLP and Private Limited Company are trusted when it comes to investment. Make sure you choose the right structure, seek the help of an expert so that you register under proper guidance.</p>
