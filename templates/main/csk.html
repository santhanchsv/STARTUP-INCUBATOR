        <h2>What do investors look for?</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective and Problem Solving:</strong> The offering of any startup should be differentiated to solve a unique customer problem or to meet specific customer needs. Ideas or products that are patented show high growth potential for investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Landscape:</strong> Market size, obtainable market-share, product adoption rate, historical and forecasted market growth rates, macroeconomic drivers for the market your plans to target.</p>
        <p><strong>Scalability and Sustainability:</strong> Startups should showcase the potential to scale in the near future, along with a sustainable and stable business plan. They should also consider barriers to entry, imitation costs, growth rate and expansion plans.</p>
        <p><strong>Customers & Suppliers:</strong> Clear identification of your buyers and suppliers. Consider customer relationships, stickiness to your product, vendor terms as well as existing vendors.</p>
        <p><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> A true picture of competition and other players in the market working on similar things should be highlighted. Consider the number of players in a market, the market share, obtainable share in the near future, product mapping to highlight similarities as well as differences between different competitor offerings.</p>
        <p><strong>Sales and Marketing:</strong> No matter how good your product or service maybe, if it does not find any end use, it is no good. Consider things like sales forecast, targeted audiences, product mix, conversion and retention ratio, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial Assessment:</strong> A detailed financial business model that showcases cash inflows over the years, investments required, key milestones, break-even points and growth rates. Assumptions used at this stage should be reasonable and clearly mentioned.</p>
        <p><strong>Exit Avenues:</strong> A startup showcasing potential future acquirers or alliance partners becomes a valuable decision parameter for the investor. Initial public offerings, acquisitions, subsequent rounds of funding are all examples of exit options.</p>
        <p><strong>Management and Team:</strong> The passion, experience and skills of the founders as well as the management team to drive the company forward are equally crucial in addition to all the factors mentioned above.</p>
        
        <h2>How do investors benefit from investing in startups?</h2>
        <p>Investors realize their return on investment from startups through various means of exit. Ideally, the VC firm and the entrepreneur should discuss the various exit options at the beginning of investment negotiations. A well performing, high-growth startup that also has excellent management and organizational processes is more likely of being exit-ready earlier than other startups. Venture Capital and Private Equity funds must exit all their investments before the end of the fund’s life. The common exit methods are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions:</strong> The investor may decide to sell the portfolio company to another company in the market.</li>
            <li><strong>IPO:</strong> Initial Public Offering is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Selling shares:</strong> Investors may sell their equity/shares to other venture capital or private equity firms.</li>
            <li><strong>Distressed Sale:</strong> Under financially stressed times for a startup company, the investors may decide to sell the business to another company or financial institution.</li>
            <li><strong>Buybacks:</strong> Founders of the startup may also buyback their shares from the fund/investors if they have liquid assets to make the purchase and wish to regain control of their company.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>What is a term sheet?</h2>
        <p>A term sheet is a “Non-binding” list of propositions by a venture capital firm at the early stages of a deal. It summarizes the major points of engagements in the deal between the investing firm/investor and the startup. A term sheet for a venture capital transaction in India typically consists of four structural provisions: valuation, investment structure, management structure and finally changes to share capital.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> Startup valuation is the total worth of the company as estimated by a professional valuer.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Structure:</strong> It defines the mode of the venture capital investment in the startup, whether it is through equity, debt or a combination of both.</li>
            <li><strong>Management Structure:</strong> The term sheet lays down the management structure of the company which includes a list for the board of directors, and prescribed appointment and removal procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Changes to share capital:</strong> All investors in startups have their own investment timelines, and accordingly they seek flexibility while analyzing exit options through subsequent rounds of funding.</li>
        </ol>
