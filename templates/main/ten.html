        <h2>What is a customer empathy map</h2>
        <p>An empath map is a tool used by user experience designers, customer experience designers, startup founders and innovation professionals that creates an understanding of the emotional and functional context of a user while undertaking an action. These actions can be referred to as touchpoints which are part of customer experience.</p>
        <p>Empathy maps are a gathering of information that depicts your ideal customer. As your team starts to gather data, it is important to know the difference between empathy and sympathy. Although the two words sound the same, they mean two different things. Empathy is when you feel and understand someone’s feelings, attitude, and experiences. It is the understanding of other’s experiences with everyday life events. Sympathy is related to feeling sorry for another person’s grief and troubles.</p>
