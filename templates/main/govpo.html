        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Government policies play a crucial role in shaping the startup ecosystem. Startups should carefully consider these policies as they can provide various benefits and opportunities for growth. Here are some key government policies for startups:</p>
        
        <h2>Startup India</h2>
        <p>Startup India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India aimed at fostering entrepreneurship and promoting innovation. Startups registered under this scheme are eligible for various benefits such as tax exemptions, self-certification compliance, and easier access to funding.</p>
        
        <h2>MSME Schemes</h2>
        <p>The Government offers several schemes and incentives for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which often include startups. These schemes may provide financial assistance, subsidies, and support for technology adoption and skill development.</p>
        
        <h2>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)</h2>
        <p>The Government has initiatives to support startups in protecting their intellectual property (IP) rights. This includes schemes for subsidizing patent filing fees, fast-tracking patent examination for startups, and providing legal assistance for IP protection.</p>
        
        <h2>Research and Development (R&D)</h2>
        <p>Government policies also encourage startups to invest in research and development activities. R&D grants, funding for innovation projects, and collaboration opportunities with research institutions are some of the incentives provided to promote innovation.</p>
        
        <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        <p>Government regulations can have a significant impact on startups. Policies related to labor laws, environmental regulations, and taxation can affect business operations. Startups should stay updated on regulatory changes and ensure compliance to avoid legal issues.</p>
